# Number Clock - Token Map Generator

## Motivation

Ever looked at a digital clock, and been tickled by the numbers shown on the face? Maybe it's something like 11:11 or 12:34. Maybe it's showing the month and day of YOUR birthday, or the area code of the town you grew up in, or the year that some important historical date happened. Personally, these moments and those numbers tickle me, and so I started putting together a clock, with the goal of having it show something interesting for every minute of the day.

This project is open source and permissively licensed. My intention is to create a physical hardware clock for myself and maybe a few friends, but there are lots of possibilities, and they all depend on having some kind of big, easy to consume data map. Anyone is permitted to take this project, and its output file, and use it for anything they want (web clock, watch face, home page widget, smart toaster, etc.)

Try the prototype here:

## Usage

### Generate a JSON file

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1. Run the script: `yarn run generate-json`
1. Look for `output-token-map.json` in the root directory
